 * 
 * Purpose: Gaddis 8ed Chapter 5 Problem 16 Savings Account Balance
 * Write a program that calculates the balance of a savings account at the end of a three month
 * period. It should ask the user for the starting balance and the annual interest rate. A
 * loop should then iterate once for every month in the period, performing the following:
 * A) Ask the user for the total amount deposited into the account during that month.
 * Do not accept negative numbers. This amount should be added to the balance.
 * B) Ask the user for the total amount withdrawn from the account during that
 * month. Do not accept negative numbers or numbers greater than the balance
 * after the deposits for the month have been added in.
 * C) Calculate the interest for that month. The monthly interest rate is the annual
 * interest rate divided by 12. Multiply the monthly interest rate by the average of
 * that monthâ€™s starting and ending balance to get the interest amount for the
 * month. This amount should be added to the balance.
