 * Purpose: Assignment 5 Problem 22 isPrime Function Gaddis 8ed Chapter 6  
 * isPrime Function
 * A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that is evenly divisible by only 1 and
 * itself. For example, the number 5 is prime because it can only be evenly divided
 * by 1 and 5. The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided by
 * 1, 2, 3, and 6.
 * Write a Boolean function named isPrime, which takes an integer as an argument and
 * returns true if the argument is a prime number, and false otherwise. Demonstrate
 * the function in a complete program.

* TIP: Recall that the % operator divides one number by another, and returns the  
* remainder of the division. In an expression such as num1 % num2, the % operator 
* will return 0 if num1 is evenly divisible by num2.
