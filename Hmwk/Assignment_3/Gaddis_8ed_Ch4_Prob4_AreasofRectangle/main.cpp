 * Purpose: Gaddis 8ed Chapter 4 Problem 4 Areas of Rectangles
 * The area of a rectangle is the rectangleâ€™s length times its width. Write a program 
 * that asks for the length and width of two rectangles. The program should tell the 
 * user which rectangle has the greater area, or if the areas are the same.
