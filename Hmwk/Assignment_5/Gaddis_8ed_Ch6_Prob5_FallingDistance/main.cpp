 * Purpose: Assignment 5 Problem 5 Falling Distance Gaddis 8ed Chapter 6
 * Falling Distance
 * The following formula can be used to determine the distance an object falls due to 
 * gravity in a specific time period:
	d = 1/2g(t^2)
 * The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8,
 * and t is the time in seconds that the object has been falling.
 * Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in
 * seconds) as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that
 * the object has fallen during that time interval. Write a program that demonstrates
 * the function by calling it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as
 * arguments, and displays the return value.
