 * Purpose: Homework Assignment 1 Gaddis Ch2 Q9
 * Cyborg Data Type Sizes
 * You have been given a job as a programmer on a Cyborg supercomputer. 
 * In order to accomplish some calculations, you need to know how many bytes the 
 * following data types use: char, int, float, and double. You do not have any manuals, 
 * so you canâ€™t look this information up. Write a C++ program that will determine the 
 * amount of memory used by these types and display the information on the screen.
